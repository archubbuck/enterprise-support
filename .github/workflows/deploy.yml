name: Deploy to App Store

# This workflow builds and deploys the iOS app to the App Store.
# It is automatically triggered when a tag starting with 'v' is pushed (e.g., v1.0.0).
#
# IMPORTANT: Tag Format Requirements
# ==================================
# Tags MUST follow this format: v<version>
#   ✅ Valid:   v1.0.0, v1.2.3, v2.0.0.1
#   ❌ Invalid: release/2026.01.26.23, 1.0.0, v1.0-beta, v1
#
# The 'release/*' tag pattern is reserved for automated GitHub releases
# and does NOT trigger App Store deployment.
#
# Prerequisites:
# Before using this workflow, ensure you have configured the following repository secrets:
#   - MATCH_PASSWORD: Password for encrypting the certificates repository
#   - MATCH_GIT_URL: Git URL of the match certificates repository (e.g., git@github.com:user/certs.git)
#   - GIT_AUTHORIZATION: GitHub Personal Access Token with 'repo' scope for private repository access
#   - APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID: App Store Connect API Issuer ID (from App Store Connect)
#   - APPSTORE_KEY_ID: App Store Connect API Key ID (from App Store Connect)
#   - APPSTORE_P8: App Store Connect API .p8 key content (raw content, not base64-encoded)
#   - APPLE_TEAM_ID: Your Apple Developer Team ID (found in App Store Connect or Developer Portal)
#
# You must also run the "iOS One-Time Match Setup" workflow ONCE before using this deployment workflow.
#
# How to deploy:
#   1. Commit your changes and ensure your code is ready for release
#   2. Create and push a version tag: git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0
#   3. This workflow will automatically build and upload to App Store Connect
