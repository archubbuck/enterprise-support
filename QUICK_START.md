# Quick Start Guide

## Configuration

Before starting development, configure the app for your enterprise by editing `company.config.json`:

```json
{
  "companyName": "Your Company",
  "appName": "Your Company Support",
  "appId": "com.yourcompany.support",
  // ... other settings
}
```

## For All Developers

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/archubbuck/barings-support.git
cd barings-support

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Web Development (Windows & Mac)
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## For Mac Developers Only

### iOS Development

#### First Time Setup
1. Install Xcode from the Mac App Store
2. Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```
3. Install CocoaPods:
   ```bash
   sudo gem install cocoapods
   ```

#### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# Build web app and sync to iOS
npm run ios:build

# Open project in Xcode
npm run ios:open
```

#### In Xcode
1. Select a simulator (iPhone 15, iPad, etc.)
2. Click the Run button (▶️) or press `Cmd + R`
3. App will launch in the simulator

#### Making Changes
1. Edit React code in `src/` directory
2. Run `npm run ios:build` to rebuild and sync
3. In Xcode, click Run to see changes

#### Deploy to Device
1. Connect iPhone/iPad via USB
2. In Xcode, select your device
3. Configure signing (select your Apple Developer team)
4. Click Run button

## For Windows Developers

You cannot build iOS apps directly on Windows, but you can:

### Option 1: Web Development (Recommended)
Develop and test using the web version - it's identical to the iOS app:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Cloud Build Services
- Set up [Ionic Appflow](https://ionic.io/appflow) or [Microsoft App Center](https://appcenter.ms/)
- Push code to GitHub
- Cloud service builds iOS app

### Option 3: Remote Mac Access
- Use [MacStadium](https://www.macstadium.com/) or [MacinCloud](https://www.macincloud.com/)
- Access remote Mac to run Xcode builds

## Tips

💡 **Tip for Windows Developers**: The web version (`npm run dev`) works exactly like the iOS app. You can do 99% of your development using the browser.

💡 **Tip for Mac Developers**: For faster development, configure Capacitor to load from localhost in development mode. See iOS_DEVELOPMENT.md for details.

💡 **Tip for Everyone**: Use `npm run build` for web-only builds, or `npm run ios:build` to build the web app and sync it to iOS in one step.
