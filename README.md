# Barings Support

A mobile-first support document hub for Barings employees to quickly access curated IT support documents and contact information, designed to work offline.

## Overview

Barings Support is built as a React web application that is packaged as a native iOS app using Capacitor. This allows the app to be distributed through the App Store while maintaining a single codebase.

## Features

- 📄 **Document Browser** - Browse IT support documents by category
- 🔍 **Search** - Quick search across all documents
- 📞 **Contact Directory** - Quick access to IT support contacts
- 🌐 **Offline Support** - All content available offline
- 🎨 **Modern UI** - Clean, iOS-native design
